## Setting custom keybinds
Go to `%appdata%\Retroblocks\`
Open config.txt
There you will find some values.
It goes:
- Left
- Right
- Hard drop
- Soft drop
- Clockwise rotation
- Counterclockwise rotation
- 180 rotation
- Hold
- DAS
- ARR
- Soft Drop Mode (true = sonic drop, false = soft drop)
- Font size
For the buttons, they are keycodes. The rest is easy to find out.

## Console problems
If you are using Chinese CMD, please wait for a bit for a Chinese compatibility switch.
If you are using Windows Terminal, please don't resize the window to be too small and don't make the font size too big. You might softlock yourself unless if you delete `%appdata%\Retroblocks\config.txt`
