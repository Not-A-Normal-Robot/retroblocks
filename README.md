# retroblocks
 A Tetris clone for cmd written in C#.  
**Warning: This project is currently in alpha. Expect bugs and missing features!**

# Running
Download this repo. The exe is located in /retroblocks/build/[platform]  
Alternatively, use these links to download:  
[x64 build](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNot-A-Normal-Robot%2Fretroblocks%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fretroblocks%2Fbuild%2Fwin-x64)  
[x86 build](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNot-A-Normal-Robot%2Fretroblocks%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fretroblocks%2Fbuild%2Fwin-x86)  
Note: ARM builds are not supported anymore.  
The program shouldn't take too much resources (it's literally just cmd) so it should be fine to use Windows's ARM x64 emulation.

# Building
Download this repo. Open the .sln file with Visual Studio.  
There should be a play button next to the word "retroblocks" on the top part of the window. Click on it to run the program.  
(Note: this is the debug version and may not be as fast as the release version)
