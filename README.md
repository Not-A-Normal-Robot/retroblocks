# retroblocks
 A Tetris clone for cmd written in C#.  
**Warning: This project is currently in alpha. Expect bugs and missing features!**

# Running
Download this repo. The exe is located in /retroblocks/build/[platform]  
Note: ARM builds are outdated and are not supported anymore.  
The program shouldn't take too much resources (it's literally just cmd) so it should be fine to use Windows's ARM x64 emulation.

# Building
Download this repo. Open the .sln file with Visual Studio.  
There should be a play button next to the word "retroblocks" on the top part of the window. Click on it to run the program.  
(Note: this is the debug version and may not be as fast as the release version)
